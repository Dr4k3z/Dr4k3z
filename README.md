# Hey guysðŸ‘‹
I'm Matteo Campagnoli, a Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano. Currently, I'm specializing in quantitative finance with a focus on derivative pricing. Coding is one of my greatest passions, and I strive to integrate it into my finance studies whenever possible.

## ðŸ“Œ **Some projects I've worked on**
-[`Star Radiation Analysis`](https://github.com/Dr4k3z/star_radiation_analysis#star-radiation-analysis) My team and I analyzed the radiation of approximately 240 stars, using several linear models to investigate the physical relationships between various stellar parameters. 
-[`Occupational Data of Mathematical Engineers`](https://aim-mate.it/orientamento/statistiche-occupazionali) Gathering occupational data from Mathematical Engineering alumni through a survey run by the Association of Mathematical Engineers, we collected information about salary progression, employment satisfaction and career paths. 
-[`Derivative Pricing Library`](https://github.com/Dr4k3z/option-calibration) Still a _work in progress_, I'm writing from scratch a `C++` library to price financial derivatives. Any contribution is more than welcomed.

I enjoy writing in $\LaTeX$, using it primarily to take notes during class. I've decided to turn my [Partial Differential Equations]() notes into a book, which I hope will be coming out soon!
